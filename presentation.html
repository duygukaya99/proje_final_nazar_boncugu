#### Project Goal &amp; Societal Benefits

Nowadays the **food system** is one of the biggest threats to nature. The time has come to reconsider and make our food system sustainable. We have to use more **agricultural land** in an efficient way and produce more foods.  
 So why not we do not produce more food in our agricultural land, Turkey's agricultural lands? Moreover, can these foods be foods that are **good to brain**? In this project we will focus on some specific foods that has good nutrients such as blueberries, avocados, nuts etc. Are they producible in **Turkey** or not, if yes why do not we produce them? While reaching healthy foods is easier in other countries, for instance Europe, why it is harder and more expensive to get them in Turkey?  
We want to show that can we **produce food while restoring the planet**.

#### In the Video Content

**It talks about** how **agriculture** have started and how important it is and tried to find an answer to question for 'How can we feed every member of growing population a **healthy** diet in the future?' Also it mentions that importance of **goal for finding agricultural system** that will increase the output while protecting biodiversity, conserving water, reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, it speaks of farm of the future by using technology etc. 
Also in 3:40 you can hear **"Producing food while restoring the planet"** part, that makes us **inspired** for our project title.

#### Introduction of data &amp; problem statement

-
We have worked with data sets that we found from [FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations)](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data)
- 
Also we have used [NASA World Map](https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/World-Map/7zbq-j77a) data set for geospatial data.

We imported our datas that we need. #data-importing


```r
agri_land_continent &lt;- read_csv("data/FAOSTAT_agriland_continent.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```



From the pie chart, it can be seen that the most agricultural land is in Asian continent.

```r
data &lt;- read_csv("data/FAOSTAT_data_agriculture.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %&gt;%
        na_if("Unknown")
```


```r
data2 &lt;- read_csv("data/FAOSTAT_data_country.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %&gt;%
         na_if("Unknown")
```

First of all, if we have missing value in our data sets, we have to omit them. That is why we checked it with is.na and we saw that there is no NA data in our data set.




```
#&gt; # A tibble: 0 x 14
#&gt; # ... with 14 variables: Domain Code &lt;chr&gt;, Domain &lt;chr&gt;,
#&gt; #   Area Code (FAO) &lt;dbl&gt;, Area &lt;chr&gt;, Element Code &lt;dbl&gt;, Element &lt;chr&gt;,
#&gt; #   Item Code &lt;dbl&gt;, Item &lt;chr&gt;, Year Code &lt;dbl&gt;, Year &lt;dbl&gt;, Unit &lt;chr&gt;,
#&gt; #   Value &lt;dbl&gt;, Flag &lt;chr&gt;, Flag Description &lt;chr&gt;
```

Let's quickly see what agriculture data contains:

```
#&gt; # A tibble: 5 x 14
#&gt;   `Domain Code` Domain `Area Code (FAO~ Area  `Element Code` Element `Item Code`
#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;
#&gt; 1 RL            Land ~                2 Afgh~           5110 Area           6610
#&gt; 2 RL            Land ~                3 Alba~           5110 Area           6610
#&gt; 3 RL            Land ~                4 Alge~           5110 Area           6610
#&gt; 4 RL            Land ~                5 Amer~           5110 Area           6610
#&gt; 5 RL            Land ~                6 Ando~           5110 Area           6610
#&gt; # ... with 7 more variables: Item &lt;chr&gt;, Year Code &lt;dbl&gt;, Year &lt;dbl&gt;,
#&gt; #   Unit &lt;chr&gt;, Value &lt;dbl&gt;, Flag &lt;chr&gt;, Flag Description &lt;chr&gt;
```
---

Let's check our column names with colnames function, since  we have two different data sets even though they are coming from same source [(FAO)](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home).


```r
colnames(data)
```


```r
colnames(data2)
```

```
#&gt;  [1] "Domain Code"      "Domain"           "Area Code (FAO)"  "Area"            
#&gt;  [5] "Element Code"     "Element"          "Item Code"        "Item"            
#&gt;  [9] "Year Code"        "Year"             "Unit"             "Value"           
#&gt; [13] "Flag"             "Flag Description"
```

Also our column names are string not numbers so that is what we want.

Let's see the structure whether they are numeric or character.


```r
str(data)
```


```r
str(data2)
```

We can see that all characters are characters and numerical datas shown as numeric, only Unit value shown as chr but 1000 ha (hectar) is numeric but we will solve this problem later.
---

Our column names are same and we have to merge them. But first we have to change some column names. Since it gives an error when we write Area Code (Fao) etc. #data-cleaning-and-reshaping


```r
tidy_data &lt;- data %&gt;%
  rename(FlagDescription = "Flag Description") %&gt;%
  rename(AreaCode = "Area Code (FAO)") %&gt;%

  select(Item, Area, Year, Unit, Value, FlagDescription) %&gt;%
  filter(FlagDescription %in% c("Official data reported on FAO Questionnaires from countries", 
                                "Calculated data",
                                "Data reported on country official publications or web sites (Official) or trade country files"))
```

Also we selected columns that we need only.

---

After we merged them, we created a new column which is called ratio, to find ratio between agricultural land and country area.


```r
tidy_datas &lt;- data2 %&gt;%
       select(Area, Item, Value, "Flag Description") %&gt;%
       merge(tidy_data, by="Area") %&gt;%
       mutate(Ratio = Value.y / Value.x) %&gt;%
       arrange(Area)
```

---
We downloaded the "world map" data set from NASA, because we wanted to show the data we obtained from different countries about agricultural land on the map. But some of the countries are written differently on the world map data set according to our data sets. For matching and binding both our data sets and world map data set We changed the names of countries. #data-visualizing


```r
# World geospatial data
library(sf)
worldmap &lt;- st_read("data/WorldMap/geo_export_25d0fbb2-27ed-4ccc-bfae-61c37f2abd5f.shp")%&gt;%
 arrange(name) %&gt;%
 rename(Area= "name")
```

Since they are not in the same order we adjust inconsistencies.


```r
tidy_datas$Area[tidy_datas$Area == "China, Taiwan Province of"] &lt;- "Taiwan"
tidy_datas$Area[tidy_datas$Area == "China, Hong Kong SAR"] &lt;- "China"
tidy_datas$Area[tidy_datas$Area == "Czechia"] &lt;- "Czech Republic"
tidy_datas$Area[tidy_datas$Area == "Falkland Islands (Malvinas)"] &lt;- "Falkland Islands"
tidy_datas$Area[tidy_datas$Area == "French Guyana"] &lt;- "French Guiana"
tidy_datas$Area[tidy_datas$Area == "Guinea-Bissau"] &lt;- "Guinea Bissau"
tidy_datas$Area[tidy_datas$Area == "North Macedonia"] &lt;- "Macedonia"
tidy_datas$Area[tidy_datas$Area == "Republic of Moldova"] &lt;- "Moldova"
tidy_datas$Area[tidy_datas$Area == "Serbia"] &lt;- "Republic of Serbia"
tidy_datas$Area[tidy_datas$Area == "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"] &lt;- "United Kingdom"
```
---

```r
tidy_datas &lt;-tidy_datas %&gt;%
            arrange(Area)
```


```r
tidy_datas1 &lt;- tidy_datas %&gt;%
            slice(-c(28,42,43,44,54,57,58))
```

Now, merge data sets by Area column first.


```r
merge_data &lt;- tidy_datas1 %&gt;%
  merge(worldmap, by="Area")
```

They are in the same order, now. "Afganistan" = "Afganistan"

```r
cbind(merge_data$Area, tidy_datas1$Area)
```

Let's keep the name same.

```r
tidy_datas1[,"Area"] &lt;- merge_data[,"Area"]
```
---
Finally, to obtain an interactive map, we create merge_data_sf which contains coordinate system.

Convert a foreign object to an sf object
 
Next we convert our data frame to a spatial data frame using the st_as_sf() function. 

```r
library(sf)
  merge_data_sf &lt;- st_as_sf(merge_data) # convert to spatial data frame
```

 In sf, we can use the function st_crs() to check the CRS used in one data.


```r
library(sf)
st_crs(merge_data_sf)
worldmap2 &lt;- st_transform(merge_data_sf, crs = 4326) 
```


```r
pal_col &lt;- colorFactor(c("#ca69e3", "#a953dd", "#9e36d2", "#9c0fbf", "#8d0a9d"),
           domain = merge_data_sf$Ratio) 
```


```r
labels &lt;-  sprintf("&lt;strong&gt;%s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Agriculture Land/Country Area = %s ", merge_data_sf$Area, merge_data_sf$Ratio)%&gt;%
            lapply(htmltools::HTML)  #converts it into a HTML content
```
---
We plot map with using leaflet() function.


```r
worlddmap &lt;- merge_data_sf %&gt;% 
              leaflet() %&gt;%  
              addPolygons(color="white", fillColor = ~pal_col(merge_data_sf$Ratio),
                          weight=1,
                          fillOpacity = 0.7,
                          label = labels) %&gt;%
            addTiles()

worlddmap
```

 *	Challenges, if any
 
  Unfortunately, we could not reach all data sets that we aimed to find due to lack of data information in Turkey.

 *  Conclusion

Although the lands of our country have fertile lands for the other fruits we mentioned besides cashew, we cannot make rapid progress in these fruits due to the insufficiency of the budget allocated for agricultural credit. But as our people's interest in these fruits increases and they learn how healthy they are for our body, the demand for these fruits will increase. And the increasing demand will bring with it more production of these fruits in our country.

          Together we can empower each and every element of our agri-food systems to collaborate
                 
                   more fairly, sustainably and inclusively from farm to table, and beyond.
                              
                         We can all learn from nature by acting with *nature*.
